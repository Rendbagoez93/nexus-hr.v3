# Implementation Plan — Nexus HR

**Version**: 1.2 | **Date**: July 2026 | **Status**: Active Development

> ⚠️ **NOTE**: Detailed build order exists only for the **Core module** (Phases 1–8).
> Attendance, HSE, and Payroll module build orders are **not yet documented**.
> Their phases below are inferred from dependency analysis and API design.

---

## Guiding Principle

> **"No employee, no system."**
> The Core module is the foundation every other module is built on top of. The Employee entity is the single source of truth. Build in dependency order.

---

## Phase 1 — Project Scaffold & Tenant Infrastructure

**Build this before anything else.**

### Tasks

- [ ] Django project structure with app separation: `apps/companies`, `apps/users`, `apps/audit`, `apps/departments`, `apps/documents`, `apps/attendance`, `apps/hse`, `apps/payroll`
- [ ] `apps/shared/` with cross-module utilities:
  - `utils/dates.py` — `get_current_utc_datetime()`, `get_current_date()`, `days_until()`, `is_date_expired()`
  - `utils/ids.py` — `generate_uuid()`, `generate_emp_number()`
  - `utils/security.py` — `hash_token()`, `generate_secure_token()`, `mask_sensitive_value()`
  - `mixins/soft_delete.py` — `SoftDeleteMixin` with `is_active` + `deleted_at` + `deactivate()`
  - `mixins/timestamped.py` — `TimestampedModel` abstract base
  - `logging/logger.py` — `get_logger()`, `log_function_call()` decorator
  - `logging/context.py` — `bind_request_context()`, `bind_task_context()`
- [ ] `TenantModel` — abstract base model with `company` FK + `TenantManager`
- [ ] `TenantManager` — custom ORM manager with `.for_company(company_id)` method
- [ ] `TenantMiddleware` — attaches `request.company_id` from JWT
- [ ] Base settings split: `settings/base.py`, `settings/local.py`, `settings/production.py`
- [ ] PostgreSQL connection configured
- [ ] `pydantic-settings` for environment/secrets management
- [ ] `structlog` + `django-structlog` configured

### Done When

- `TenantModel` has `company = ForeignKey(Company, ...)` and uses `TenantManager`
- `TenantMiddleware` injects `request.company_id` correctly
- A test proves tenant-scoped querying works

---

## Phase 2 — Company

**The tenant boundary. Everything else is a child of Company.**

### Tasks

- [ ] `Company` model — name, industry, subscription tier, active flag, geofence fields, timestamps
- [ ] `SubscriptionPlan` model — `has_attendance`, `has_hse`, `has_payroll` flags
- [ ] `CompanySubscription` model — links company to plan, billing period, active employee count
- [ ] Django Admin registration for all three models
- [ ] `apps/companies/constants.py` — all business constants (BPJS rates, PTKP values, etc.)
- [ ] `apps/companies/choices.py` — all TextChoices classes

### Done When

- Platform Admin can create a Company via Django Admin
- `CompanySubscription` correctly reflects enabled modules
- New Company has clean slate (no users, no employees)

---

## Phase 3 — Auth & AuthUser

**Identity layer. Every person starts here.**

### Tasks

- [ ] Custom `AuthUser` model extending `AbstractBaseUser` — email login, role field, company FK
- [ ] Role choices: `platform_admin`, `hr_admin`, `manager`, `employee`, `hse_officer`
- [ ] JWT authentication via `djangorestframework-simplejwt`
  - Access token: short-lived (60 min)
  - Refresh token: long-lived (30 days)
- [ ] `RefreshToken` model — `token_hash`, `expires_at`, `device_id`, `is_revoked`
- [ ] `POST /api/v1/auth/login` — exchange email + password for tokens
- [ ] `POST /api/v1/auth/token/refresh` — refresh access token
- [ ] `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` — revoke refresh token
- [ ] `POST /api/v1/auth/password/change` — change own password
- [ ] `LoginSchema` in `apps/users/schemas.py`
- [ ] Auth service in `apps/users/services/auth.py`
- [ ] `TenantMiddleware` update: extract `company_id` from JWT payload
- [ ] Platform Admin: created via `manage.py createsuperuser` only — never JWT for HR dashboard

### Done When

- HR Admin can log in and receive JWT
- JWT contains `user_id`, `company_id`, `role`
- Logout invalidates refresh token
- Cross-company token test passes

---

## Phase 4 — Department

---

## Phase 5 — Position

**Job titles with salary bands.**

### Tasks

- [ ] `Position` model — title, level, department FK, company FK, salary min/max, soft delete

  - `POST /api/v1/positions`
  - `GET /api/v1/positions/{id}`

## Testing Strategy (All Phases)

For every phase, write tests in parallel:

| Test File | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| `test_models.py` | Model constraints, `__str__`, computed properties |
| `test_services.py` | Service function unit tests (mock only external I/O) |
| `test_views.py` | API endpoint tests (HTTP in, HTTP out) |
| `test_permissions.py` | Every role × action × company combination |
| `test_tenant_isolation.py` | Cross-company data protection |

### Coverage Requirements

| App | Minimum |
|-----|---------|
| companies | 85% |
| users | 85% |
| audit | 85% |
| attendance | 80% |
| hse | 80% |
| payroll | 85% |
| shared | 90% |

### Testing Rules

- Use `factory-boy` factories — never `Model.objects.create()` in tests
- Assert exact status codes — never `response.ok`
- Assert `403` for cross-tenant — never `404`
- Use `freezegun` for date-sensitive tests
- Mock only external I/O (S3, email, Celery) — never mock the database
